# portfolio-framework
A minimal placeholder and resource list for the UVic WebDev Workshop 1: Intro to HTML and CSS

###Getting Started:

1. Make sure you have a text editor installed. Some recommended editors are Sublime and Atom:
⋅⋅* http://www.sublimetext.com/2
⋅⋅* https://atom.io/

2. Download this repo's ZIP file (There is a "Download ZIP button on this page")

3. Open that file in your favorite internet browser (Chrome lol)
⋅⋅* For example, if I saved the zip file on my Desktop, I would go to this address in my browser: file:///Users/kelseylegault/Desktop/portfolio-framework/index.html

4. Play around with the framework and make it your own. Ask questions. Make a meme. Have fun and believe in all things.
